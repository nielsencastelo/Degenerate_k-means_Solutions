1) The 'teste.m' file you can compare methods using Eilon database. The variable 'metodo' you choose one of six methods. The function 'kme.m' uses the First improving strategy and 'kmf.m' uses the Last improving strategy. 
2) The 'teste_20_v2.m' file runs 20 times all methods and reports (It can be time consuming depending on the type of computer).
3) The 'teste_degeneracy_kmeans.m' file has an animation (step by step) in Matlab using the synthetic database that is the degeneration of 1 cluster (k = 4).
4) The 'teste_degeneracy_metodos.m' file has an animation removing degeneration in k-means.
5) The 'dkmeans.m' file is the traditional k-means with the choice of two strategies: 'First Improving' and 'Last Improving' to remove the degeneration.
The file 'teste_dkmeans' shows an example of clustering using the base Ruspini.
